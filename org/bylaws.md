Directors may participate in a meeting via telephone or electronic video screen communication (e.g. Skype, Google Hangout, etc.), so long as all members participating in such meeting can hear one another.

#### K. Action Without a Meeting of the Board.

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of such directors.

#### L. Directors' Duty of Care.

A director shall perform the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

In performing the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:

1. One or more officers or employees of this corporation whom the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
2. Counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the director believes to be within such person's professional or expert competence; or
3. A committee of the board upon which the director does not serve, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the director believes to merit confidence, so long as, in any such case, the director acts in good faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need therefore is indicated by the circumstances and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.

#### M. Directors' Duty of Loyalty.

Subject to being able to comply with subdivision (d) of Section 5233 of the Law or any successor section thereto \[FOOTNOTE], prior to consummating a "self-dealing transaction" or any part thereof, as defined by Section 5233 of the Law or any successor section thereto, either

1. The board shall authorize or approve the transaction in good faith by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office without counting the vote of the interested director or directors, and with knowledge of the material facts concerning the transaction and the director's interest in the transaction; and, further, prior to authorizing or approving a self-dealing transaction, shall consider and in good faith determine after reasonable investigation under the circumstances that this corporation could not have obtained a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; or
2. Where it is not reasonably practical to obtain approval of the board prior to entering into the transaction, a committee or person authorized by the board shall approve the transaction in a manner consistent with the standards set forth in clause (1) of this section. In the event the procedure of clause (2) of this section is followed, the board, after determining in good faith that the conditions of clause (2) of this section are satisfied, shall ratify the transaction at its next meeting by a vote of the majority of the directors then in office without counting the vote of the interested director or directors.

Subject to being able to comply with Section 5234(a)(2) of the Law, no contract or other transaction between this corporation and any corporation, firm or association in which one or more directors are directors shall be authorized, approved or ratified by the board or a committee of the board unless the material facts as to the transaction and as to the director's or directors' common directorships are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee of the board, and the board or a committee of the board authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the common director or directors.

Interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board which authorizes, approves or ratifies a self-dealing transaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
Section 5233 defines “self-dealing transaction” to mean a transaction to which the corporation is a party and in which one or more directors has a material financial interest. A “self-dealing transaction” does not include (a) an action of the board fixing the compensation of a director as a director or officer of this corporation; (b) a transaction which is part of a public or charitable program of this corporation if it: (i) is approved or authorized by this corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism; and (ii) results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the public or charitable program; or (c) a transaction of which the interested director or directors have no actual knowledge, and which does not exceed the lesser of one percent (1%) of the gross receipts of this corporation for the preceding fiscal year or one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).

#### N. Removal and Filling Vacancies.

The board may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of a court, or convicted of a felony, or who has been found by a final order or judgment of any court to have breached any duty arising under Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the Law or any successor article thereto. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office during the unexpired term of his predecessor in office and until his successor is elected. Any vacancy occurring on the board of directors as well as any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by approval of the board or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice complying with Section 5211, or (3) a sole remaining director.

#### O. Compensation.

Directors as such shall not receive any stated salaries for their services, but by resolution of the board of directors a just and reasonable fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, may be allowed for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the board or any committee of the board; but, subject to the restrictions of Section C of Article VI of these Bylaws, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this corporation in any other capacity and receiving just and reasonable compensation therefor.

Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors of this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. The board of directors may elect a successor to fill a vacancy caused thereby, or if the resignation is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.

### XII. Indemnification of Directors and Officers

This corporation shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, and subject to Section 5260 of the California Nonprofit Corporation Law, indemnify each of its present or former directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding or any threatened proceeding (hereinafter "proceeding" includes any threatened proceeding) arising by reason of the fact that any such person is or was a director or officer of this corporation; provided that the board of directors determines that such director or officer was acting in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful. Payments authorized hereunder include amounts paid and expenses incurred in settling any such proceeding. The foregoing does not apply to any proceeding specifically excluded by law, which includes actions brought by or in the right of this corporation and certain actions alleging self-dealing or a breach of any duty relating to assets held in charitable trust.

If, because of the nature of the proceeding, this corporation is prohibited by law from indemnifying its directors or officers against judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts, this corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such proceeding arising by reason of the fact that any such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation; provided that the board of directors determines that such director or officer was acting in good faith and in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances; and further provided that, to the extent required by law, the authority specified by law shall also approve the indemnification provided for by this paragraph.

Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by this corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount of the advance unless it is determined ultimately that the director or officer is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this article or by law.

The board of directors may authorize this corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any director or officer against any liability asserted against or incurred by such person in such capacity or arising out of the person's status as such, whether or not this corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability.

This article does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that person's capacity as such, even though that person may also be a director or officer of this corporation. Nothing contained in this article shall limit any right to indemnification to which such a trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary may be entitled by contract or otherwise, which shall be enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law.

### XIII. Limitation of Liability of Certain Directors and Officers

#### A. Limitation of Liability of Volunteer Directors and Volunteer Executive Officers to Third Parties.

There shall be no personal liability to a third party on the part of a volunteer director or volunteer executive officer caused by the director's or officer's negligent act or omission in the performance of that person's duties as a director or officer, if all of the following conditions are met:

1. The act or omission was within the scope of the director's or executive officer's duties;
2. The act or omission was performed in good faith;
3. The act or omission was not reckless, wanton, intentional, or grossly negligent; and
4. Damages caused by the act or omission are covered pursuant to a liability insurance policy issued to the corporation, either in the form of a general liability policy or a director's and officer's liability policy, or personally to the director or executive officer. In the event that the damages are not covered by a liability insurance policy, the volunteer director or volunteer executive officer shall not be personally liable for the damages if the board of directors and the person had made all reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain available liability insurance.

"Volunteer" means the rendering of services without compensation. "Compensation" means remuneration whether by way of salary, fee, or other consideration for services rendered. However, the payment of per diem, mileage, or other reimbursement expenses to a director or executive officer does not affect that person's status as a volunteer with the meaning of this Section A.

"Executive officer" means the president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, or such other person who serves in like capacity, who assists in establishing the policy of the corporation.

Nothing in this Section A shall limit the liability of the corporation for any damages caused by acts or omissions of the volunteer director or volunteer executive officer.

This Section A does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer for any of the following:

1. As provided in Section 5233 or 5237 of the California Nonprofit Corporation Law; or
2. In any action or proceeding brought by the Attorney General.

Nothing in this Section A creates a duty of care or basis of liability for damage or injury caused by the acts or omissions of a director or officer.

#### B. Limitation of Liability of Certain Directors.

Except as provided in Section 5233 or 5237 of the California Non-profit Corporation Law, there is no monetary liability on the part of, and no cause of action for damages shall arise against, any non-paid director, including any non-paid director who is also a non-paid officer, of this corporation based upon any alleged failure to discharge the person's duties as director or officer if the duties are performed in a manner that meets all of the following criteria:

1. The duties are performed in good faith;
2. The duties are performed in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation; and
3. The duties are performed with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

### XIV. Corporate Loans, Guarantees and Advances

Except as provided by the California Non-profit Corporation Law (Section 5236), this corporation shall not make any loan of money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer.

### XV. Amendments to Bylaws

These Bylaws shall fully amend and replace the previous initial Bylaws that were adopted by the Corporation as of January 3, 2014.

New Bylaws may be adopted or these Bylaws may be amended or repealed by the approval of the board of directors.
