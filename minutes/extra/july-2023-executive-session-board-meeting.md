### 6:07 pm— Current Issues <a href="#id-84iqkmbhjywq" id="id-84iqkmbhjywq"></a>

Amanda has expressed frustration with the current state of the station and her duties. Issues that have arisen as of late:

* Haven’t started any fundraising from the consultant.
* More volunteers, but more management of the volunteers
* Social media (amanda creates posts to vivian to post)
* Fielding a lot of tech help
* Too many things are taking away from the core responsibilities.

What things are closest to the mission? What do we need to focus on?

Station is turning 10 years old, possible a good time to re-focus.
