### Discussion Topics

**Board Committee Updates**

**Board Nominations:**

**Brandon Paski:** Brandon helped found the marketing committee at BFF and helped us figure out promotions and a street team. As a previous board member, he is interested in coming back and excited to be back in an advisory capacity. Brandon shared that he is interested in using what we’ve built in marketing to power fundraising.

Irving nominated, Kerri seconded.

{% hint style="success" %}
ALL voted YES in favor of Brandon joining the board.
{% endhint %}

**Kenya Lewis:** Kenya reached out to put the LPFM on our radar and has been a great advisor and connector for BFF for years. She was the one that connected us with Michael Brown for our LPFM application. Kenya is a big BFF fan who believes in the power of radio to connect with each other and experiment. She is interested in connecting terrestrial and non-terrestrial stations and built a LPFM page to connect people, which has now grown to almost 1000 folks. Kenya may be able to help us get the LPFM up and running or connect us to experts who can help. Her perspective on making knowledge more accessible and building community = very BFF mission-aligned.

Amanda nominated, Mark seconded.

{% hint style="success" %}
ALL voted YES in favor of Kenya joining the board.

_Mark, who had joined the meeting just to approve the new board members, had to leave at this time._

**Updates on Other Prospects:**&#x20;

Amanda will connect with Mark to see if he’s spoken with Reina.

Brandon connected with Nathan, who is a Bay Area native, has worked for Pandora, and is familiar with radio and online radio. They talked about marketing from a fundraising angle, how can we use data in GiveButter to discover what’s working well and amplify it. He has some great ideas; music lover who learned English through music.

Vena - via the LinkedIn job post - currently CFO of another nonprofit that raises money and supports people in the advertising industry who have fallen on hard times, people who are laid off, etc. Could be a financial mentor to help us understand BFF's budget better and how to manage it. Irving, who doesn’t come from a financial or accounting background, has been taking care of the books and transactions and filing taxes for BFF, but in terms of projecting forwards and forecasting, that doesn’t feel like his wheelhouse. Vena could help with that and would be helpful to Irving. Happy to move on to next steps.&#x20;

Daniel, manager of Cafe Du Nord, has an artist management company; had a good chat with Amanda, but Amanda hasn’t heard back about his interest. He’s currently out of the country.

**Board Retreat + first strategy session of 2026** - would like to have as many board members as possible in it; Amanda will check with AddieRose for an end of January timeframe. We can have an extra early January meeting to confirm a few more board members (hopefully).

Board members to check Slack to confirm dates.

**Finance Committee:** Taxes filed for this year, accepted by the IRS. Some paperwork crunching and filing for grant applications in the works. Balance sheet updated, but a bit behind on labeling the transactions.

**EOY Fundraising:** Our theme is TURN IT UP! Irving dedicated his birthday to us and got a Salesforce match, so we’re already 30% to our goal - yahoo! All board members are encouraged to make their own Fundraise page, create your own subgoal within a larger campaign, and also to promote our fundraisers on your social media, in your IRL connections, etc.

**SFAC Grant:** we’re feeling good about it, having made some adjustments based on feedback. Locals ONLY is built into the grant goals (ex. source tracks from local bands over the year, etc.) using this as a bit of a more defined project to make us more appealing to future grants, etc.

**Grant research:** a new volunteer in the fundraising committee has raised their hand to help, yay! Should have more info on local grants next year. Kenya is down to help with this too.

**Executive Updates**:&#x20;

* SF State - met with Jeff who is the chair of BECA - we love Jeff! Passionate about radio and education around radio and loves working with the students. He really wants BFF to have our LPFM tower on the campus - huge that he wants to be an advocate. Amanda connected Jeff with Michael Brown. Pipeline from college to BFF.fm, like KUSF \~ that’s not his priority, which is also kind of great, but could be an opportunity for us still.
* COYOTE x BFF Giving Tuesday fundraiser! Emma Silvers arts and culture lead connection with Amanda, potential partnership would be fun to do events together. FREE RSVP and link to share with friends here: [https://luma.com/f2jy4dho](https://luma.com/f2jy4dho)
* 2026 Strategy meetings with committees have been happening or are about to happen.&#x20;

_**No other business.**_
