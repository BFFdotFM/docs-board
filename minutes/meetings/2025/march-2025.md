### Discussion Topics

#### Board Term Expiration: Ben Ward

Ben’s second board term is up, and he will not be standing for another term. Thank you, Ben, for all you’ve done for BFF.fm in the past 6 years!

Ben shared, in summary:

"Proud to have served this organization for over a decade! As Technical Director, secretary, and now as co-chair. The board's success these past 3 months in navigating the transition is something for all to be proud of. I’m excited now to contribute as a regular volunteer, which I think is a testament to how well this transformation has gone. More and new people are visible, and that’s something to celebrate.

But, my time is at an ever greater premium — it's harder doing board meetings at baby bedtime! — I want to be mindful of the most effective ways to contribute to this wonderful place.

Fundraising and networking obligations of the board role have not been a good fit for me, so focus on being an operational contributor to the station feels more appropriate. Thank you all so much! I'm glad to have been here."

Ben will finish up the month as a board member and stay on as a Tech Committee volunteer.

#### BFF.fm Trademark

Recently received an update and bill re: trademark filing

Mark explained what the trademark filing is and why it’s important, namely:

* Prevent another radio station/similar service from using BFF.fm
* Some contractual relationships or grants may require proof of trademark
* LPFM may require proof of trademark

Presuming there’s no further office action or that Buzzfeed doesn’t object, there wouldn’t be any more legal work on the matter until renewal (\~5 years after registration is granted). If the examiner rejects our filing or another party comes forward to oppose it, then we’d make a decision as a board whether to pursue or not. (We could go to Buzzfeed, ask them to sign a letter of consent in case of refusal.)

Board agrees it makes sense to move forward with this for now.

Clair to reach out to the lawyer for payment, clarify point of contact and ask to reach out before any future action is taken.

#### Executive Sessions

Prior to moving to better promote board meetings to the BFF community and invite public observers, we wanted to clearly understand and document where private/confidential executive sessions should be applied.

* Executive sessions should be used for matters of: Employment status, disciplinary actions, contract terms.
* Q: Is there a standard for notes redaction/delayed publication of executive sessions?  A: Actually, for a true executive session, notes should not be taken.

#### BFF.fm Venmo Account

* Do we want to pursue a business profile?
* Use case: Listening parties: band, Stable, snack reimbursement
* Ben shared: [Venmo Charity Profile](https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/6678084998291-Charity-Profile-FAQ)&#x20;
* Irving researched already: Venmo business still needs a phone number, which doesn’t work for us
* Merch at events - use QR code for Givebutter

#### Committee leads at Board Meeting

* Invite committee leads to do an update at the beginning of board meetings
* Talk to committee leads at next meeting to figure out solid participation but not too many/too long board meetings - proposal: committee reports every three months (rotation)
* Discuss with committee leads what an appropriate format would be for these report-outs: think high-level share, noting what you might like the board to weigh in on, “bring committee matters up to the strategic level, not pulling the board down into the operational”
* Board members encouraged to read committee notes before every meeting

### Public Comment?

* No public comment.

### Any committee highlights?

* Transition Working Group met briefly to talk about Doorbot operations; looking to add multiple people to the fallback call list for accessing the studio.

### 7:15 pm — Meeting adjourned.

The next meeting of the BFF.fm board is scheduled for April 8th 2025. See [https://board.bff.fm](https://board.bff.fm) for more information.<br>
