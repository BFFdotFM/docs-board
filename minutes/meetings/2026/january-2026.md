# January 2026

Saturday, January 24th, 10am-4pm&#x20;

180 Capp street&#x20;

Facilitated by AddieRose Mayer

#### Board Retreat Objectives:

* Build strong relationships, trust, and shared identity among new and returning board members so the board can operate as a connected, collaborative governance team grounded in BFF.fm’s culture and values.
* Create shared understanding and alignment around BFF.fm’s mission, programs, and emerging 2026 priorities so the board is rooted in a common purpose and strategic direction.
* Establish expectations for board leadership, engagement, and partnership with Station Leadership so members know how to contribute their time, talents, and influence in ways that meaningfully support BFF.fm’s success.

#### Agenda

Between activities each board member will be invited to share a favorite song

Please note that we will use dynamic facilitation and therefore times are estimates and are likely to change&#x20;
