# Irving Pham

[Board treasurer](https://board.bff.fm/members/roles/treasurer). Hosts [audiosyncrasies](https://bff.fm/shows/audiosyncrasies), Fridays 9-10 pm

I was born and raised in Los Angeles and spent time in college riding bikes and listening to music instead of studying, paving the way to becoming the person I am today. I have professional experience working with public transit agencies, non-profits and government agencies. For the past 8 years I have worked in the appraisal industry, where I have to keep track of market trends, capitalization rates, property tax laws and keep track of rental rates, expenses and construction costs in various spreadsheets and programs to determine the value of residential and commercial properties. Much like one of my favorite bands and genres (Pavement/slacker rock), I hope people describe me as laid back and relaxed but also know I have the chops to handle the responsibilities thrown my way.
