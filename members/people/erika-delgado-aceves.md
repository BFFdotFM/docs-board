# Erika Delgado Aceves

Chair of Events committee. They present [Abuela's Pantry](https://bff.fm/shows/abuela-s-pantry) on Friday afternoons.

Erika Delgado Aceves was born in San Francisco to two Mexican immigrants who didn't meet far from [BFF.fm](http://bff.fm/)'s headquarters. Erika has lived a nurtured, creative life and has found safety within [BFF.fm](http://bff.fm/) and the art community it has brought together. As a queer, first-gen, disabled creative with the privilege to have a platform, Erika has devoted a large portion of their life to sharing the mic.

They are a California College of the Arts alumni, a South San Francisco resident with SF Mission roots.\
