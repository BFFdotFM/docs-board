Amanda Guest is the founder and station manager of [BFF.fm](http://bff.fm/). She has been involved in college and community radio since 1994, becoming a DJ on WMWM 91.7fm as a freshman at Salem State University. Amanda launched [BFF.fm](http://bff.fm/) in 2013 out of a love of indie music and community radio, and because she wanted to create a place where a whole new generation of post-collegiate music nerds could unite and geek-out over awesome new music.

After all these years and changes in how it's delivered — from terrestrial broadcast to online streaming — Amanda still believes in the power of community radio to play a positive role in our local music scene.

Amanda presents [the BFF.fm Top 30](https://bff.fm/shows/top30) and [Radioculars](https://bff.fm/shows/radioculars) on BFF.fm.
