# Clair McDevitt

[Board Secretary](../roles/secretary.md), Chair of Fundraising Committee

Clair McDevitt has spent most of the past 20 years living in San Francisco, where she has worked in communications and fundraising roles in the non-profit sector. Most recently, she was the communications manager for the Low Income investment Fund, where she wrote about all facets of community development with a focus on the interconnected housing and economic opportunity challenges facing the Bay Area.

Clair wrote her first letter to a radio station DJ in 1987 and has spent much of her free time since listening to the radio. She’s been a long-time listener to BFF.fm and a volunteer since December 2020, helping the station win its first-ever grant and providing other fundraising and sponsorship support. Clair hopes to use her time on the board to help support San Francisco’s music and culture scene and provide more opportunities for diverse voices to access community radio.

When not listening to the radio, Clair is a cyclist, avid SF Giants fan, and human to a very good dog.
